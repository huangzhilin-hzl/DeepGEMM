Profiler timings are deliberately not substituted for the benchmark score.
NCU replay and multi-process NSYS tracing perturb the cooperative workload;
they are used for topology, resource, and bottleneck attribution only.

## Iteration 00: baseline and profiler plumbing

### Reason

The original profiler scripts did not delimit the single production launch,
and NCU replay of all eight distributed processes deadlocked at collective
barriers. Add an opt-in CUDA profiler range to `--profile-only`, then run one
NCU instance per rank so every participant advances through the same replay
pass.

### Direction

- `DG_NCU_RANGE=1` wraps only the target launch, its device synchronize, and
  the rank barrier with `cudaProfilerStart/Stop`.
- The environment variable defaults to zero, so normal correctness and
  performance runs are unchanged.
- NCU uses eight independent application-replay profilers and PM Sampling.
- NSYS uses a low-perturbation mode: only rank 0 is traced while ranks 1-7 run
  normally.

### Baseline performance

`delta` is `(candidate / PR383 - 1) * 100`; positive values are regressions.

| model | M | PR383 us | candidate us | delta |

Aggregate regression versus PR383:

- all 22 cases: +20.36% geometric mean;
- M <= 128: +45.93% geometric mean;
- M >= 256: +2.51% geometric mean.

### NCU and NSYS findings

| implementation | launch topology | registers/thread | dynamic SMEM/CTA |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| candidate Flash M8 | one persistent kernel, 156 CTAs | 128 | 111.84 KiB |
| candidate Pro M8 | one persistent kernel, 156 CTAs | 128 | 102.62 KiB |
| PR383 Flash M8 | L1 + L2, 78 CTAs each | 168 | 231.70 KiB |
| PR383 Pro M8 | L1 + L2, 78 CTAs each | 168 | 213.76 KiB |

The candidate explicitly consumes two resident CTAs per H20 SM. PR383 runs
one high-resource CTA per SM for each phase. PM Sampling also reports only 25%
maximum active warps for the candidate and 18.75% for PR383; neither latency
case is occupancy-throughput limited. Absolute replay timings and sampled
utilization vary widely across ranks, so the stable evidence is the launch and
resource topology rather than the replay duration.

Low-perturbation NSYS confirms one fused candidate launch versus two sequential
PR383 launches. Even this mode inflates timings and reverses the uninstrumented
ranking, so it is retained as a dependency/timeline view only.

### Next experiments

1. For M <= 128, test a 78-worker cooperative grid while preserving the
   156-worker path for M >= 256. This directly tests whether the second
   resident CTA amplifies dispatch, grid-barrier, and low-work contention.
2. If 78 workers help, compile a true one-CTA/SM latency variant with a relaxed
   launch bound and a larger per-CTA register budget to eliminate spills.
3. Specialize fixed dispatch/combine barriers only after the worker-count
   experiment quantifies their contribution.
4. Reject any change that regresses either model at M >= 256 beyond run-to-run
   noise.

### Result

No kernel behavior changed in iteration 00. The benchmark values above remain
the branch baseline.

## Rejected experiment R01: one worker CTA per SM

### Reason and direction

NCU showed a 156-CTA candidate grid versus 78 CTAs per PR383 phase. To test
whether the second resident CTA was mostly fixed dispatch/barrier overhead,
M <= 128 was changed temporarily from `2 * physical_sms` workers to
`physical_sms` workers. The kernel remained at 128 registers/thread and kept
the same pipeline; M >= 256 was untouched.

### Performance

| model | M | baseline us | experiment us | change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| flash | 8 | 449.780 | 656.990 | +46.07% |
| flash | 16 | 494.348 | 723.421 | +46.34% |

Both points used the full 50-observation benchmark contract. The experiment
was stopped after the second completed point because the regression was far
outside measurement noise; the source change was reverted and not committed.

### Conclusion

The second resident CTA provides necessary compute parallelism in the current
128-register kernel. A useful one-CTA path must also reclaim the per-SM
register/shared-memory budget and change the pipeline, rather than only
shrinking the grid. The next iteration therefore targets latency-path register
pressure or fixed synchronization inside the existing two-CTA grid.

## Iteration 02: blockwise Flash swap-AB for M <= 32

### Reason

NCU ruled out local-memory traffic as the baseline bottleneck: Pro M8 reported
zero local loads/stores, while the fused kernel spent 18.73% of sampled cycles
on long-scoreboard stalls versus 4.86-6.08% in PR383's two phase kernels. The
baseline also issues an M64 x N128 WGMMA for experts that commonly own fewer
than eight tokens. Repository history showed that an earlier per-tensor-scale
kernel avoided this waste by swapping the WGMMA operands at small M, but the
path was removed when routed activations changed to per-block scaling.

### Direction

- Keep the 156-CTA, two-resident-CTA launch topology proven necessary by R01.
- Treat each N64 weight half as WGMMA M and bucket routed tokens into WGMMA N8,
  N16, N32, or N64.
- Preserve the current blockwise numerical contract: promote each L1 K128 and
  L2 K64 group with its staged activation scale, and retain cross-promotion
  partials as packed BF16.
- Remap the swapped L1 result through SwiGLU and a cross-warp dynamic-scale
  reduction; remap L2 back into the existing BF16 scatter layout.
- Use epilogue-exclusive C/D shared memory for the scale reduction. Reusing a
  released pipeline stage caused the producer to overwrite the reduction
  scratch and was rejected during correctness development.
- Enable the specialization only for routed-only Flash with M <= 32. The
  crossover sweep below shows that M64 is neutral-to-slower and M128 is a clear
  regression.

### Crossover sweep

This sweep temporarily enabled swap-AB through M128. It uses the same 50
observations, cold-L2 policy, and `max_rank_median_us` score as the baseline.

| M | baseline us | swap-AB us | change |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | 449.780 | 414.278 | -7.89% |
| 16 | 494.348 | 450.907 | -8.79% |
| 32 | 503.078 | 463.545 | -7.86% |
| 64 | 487.814 | 493.518 | +1.17% |
| 128 | 489.759 | 683.926 | +39.64% |

### Final performance

After fixing the selector at M <= 32, all five points were rerun from the final
source. M64 and M128 compile the regular baseline path.

| M | baseline us | final us | change | PR383 us | gap to PR383 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | 449.780 | 413.731 | -8.01% | 301.924 | +37.03% |
| 16 | 494.348 | 445.744 | -9.83% | 312.858 | +42.47% |
| 32 | 503.078 | 456.946 | -9.17% | 328.370 | +39.16% |
| 64 | 487.814 | 483.059 | -0.97% | 361.647 | +33.57% |
| 128 | 489.759 | 508.761 | +3.88% | 433.330 | +17.41% |

The geometric-mean gain over the branch baseline is 9.01% for the three
enabled points and 4.97% over M8-M128. The remaining M8-M32 geometric-mean gap
to PR383 falls from 53.30% to 39.54%. The unchanged M128 path varied by +3.88%
in this run; it has no generated swap-AB code and is retained as run-to-run
noise rather than widening the selector.

### Correctness and resource result

- Eight-rank `production.flash_m32` with forced ring wrap passes at
  `diff=0.000656` (`0.01` tolerance).
- The specialized kernel uses 128 registers and four barriers. PTXAS reports a
  448-byte stack frame, 518 bytes of spill stores, and 604 bytes of spill
  loads, plus serialized WGMMA due to the fixed 128-register launch bound.
- The resource report identifies the next target: shorten the live range of
  the swap epilogue/partial arrays enough to restore WGMMA issue parallelism,
  without giving up two resident CTAs.

## Iteration 03: extend blockwise swap-AB to Pro M <= 64

### Reason and direction

Iteration 02 left the largest small-M gaps in DSV4 Pro: +70.17% at M8 and
+47.73% at M64. Pro uses the same routed MXFP4 numerical contract and fixed
M64 x N128 Humming tile, so the validated blockwise swap-AB path was extended
to H7168/I3072. Pro aliases the second decoded-weight buffer with C/D shared
memory to preserve two-CTA occupancy; the alias is safe because the C/D
epilogue begins only after the routed mainloop has finished.

A temporary selector enabled the Pro path through M256 to locate the actual
crossover before choosing a production cutoff.

| M | baseline us | crossover sweep us | change |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | 1179.500 | 1060.000 | -10.13% |
| 16 | 1538.500 | 1350.000 | -12.25% |
| 32 | 1598.000 | 1395.500 | -12.67% |
| 64 | 1634.000 | 1461.000 | -10.59% |
| 128 | 1637.000 | 1773.500 | +8.34% |
| 256 | 1663.000 | 3957.000 | +137.94% |

The sweep used ten observations per point only to select the boundary. It
rejects M128/M256 and fixes the final Pro selector at M <= 64. The accepted
points were then rerun with the full 50-observation contract.

### Final performance

| M | baseline us | final us | change | PR383 us | gap to PR383 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | 1179.500 | 1042.000 | -11.66% | 693.125 | +50.33% |
| 16 | 1538.500 | 1328.000 | -13.68% | 971.170 | +36.74% |
| 32 | 1598.000 | 1390.500 | -12.98% | 1064.547 | +30.62% |
| 64 | 1634.000 | 1448.500 | -11.35% | 1106.107 | +30.95% |
| 128 | 1637.000 | 1646.500 | +0.58% | 1228.166 | +34.06% |

The four enabled points improve by 12.42% geometric mean. Their geometric-
mean gap to PR383 falls from 56.36% to 36.94%. Across Pro M8-M128, including
the unchanged M128 path, the gain is 9.97% geometric mean.

### Correctness and resource result

- Eight-rank, forced-ring-wrap validation passes at `diff=0.005395` for
  `production.pro_m32` and `diff=0.003913` for `production.pro_m64`.
- PTXAS reports 128 registers, four barriers, a 488-byte stack frame, 584
  bytes of spill stores, and 732 bytes of spill loads for Pro M32, with the
  same fixed-register WGMMA serialization warning as Flash.
- The next optimization should split the shared blockwise math from the
  model-specific remap so the N8/N16 specializations do not carry arrays sized
  for N64. That is the most direct route to reduce the reported local frame and
  long-scoreboard pressure while preserving the proven launch topology.
