# SM90 MXFP4 MegaMoE optimization log

This log tracks the profiler-guided optimization work on
`molou/support_sm90_humming_mxfp4afp8_megamoe_auto`.

## Measurement contract

- GPU: 8 x NVIDIA H20 (SM90), one process per GPU.
- Authoritative benchmark: `tests/bench_mega_moe_sm90.py`.
- Models: DSV4 `flash` and `pro`.
- Batch sizes: `8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192`.
- Cache policy: cold L2 (`--flush-l2`, the benchmark default).
- Score: `max_rank_median_us`; lower is better.
- Small-M observations: 50; large-M observations: 3; 20 launches per
  observation.
- Baseline candidate: `5c060dc51427b497384d1b42f2b01263813c2d87`.
- Reference: PR383 at `0220ac51939dcaa2b4c9aa6aa60c5a9bf8785aa4`.

Profiler timings are deliberately not substituted for the benchmark score.
NCU replay and multi-process NSYS tracing perturb the cooperative workload;
they are used for topology, resource, and bottleneck attribution only.

## Iteration 00: baseline and profiler plumbing

### Reason

The original profiler scripts did not delimit the single production launch,
and NCU replay of all eight distributed processes deadlocked at collective
barriers. Add an opt-in CUDA profiler range to `--profile-only`, then run one
NCU instance per rank so every participant advances through the same replay
pass.

### Direction

- `DG_NCU_RANGE=1` wraps only the target launch, its device synchronize, and
  the rank barrier with `cudaProfilerStart/Stop`.
- The environment variable defaults to zero, so normal correctness and
  performance runs are unchanged.
- NCU uses eight independent application-replay profilers and PM Sampling.
- NSYS uses a low-perturbation mode: only rank 0 is traced while ranks 1-7 run
  normally.

### Baseline performance

`delta` is `(candidate / PR383 - 1) * 100`; positive values are regressions.

| model | M | PR383 us | candidate us | delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| flash | 8 | 301.924 | 449.780 | +48.97% |
| flash | 16 | 312.858 | 494.348 | +58.01% |

| flash | 128 | 433.330 | 489.759 | +13.02% |
| flash | 256 | 518.971 | 533.920 | +2.88% |
| flash | 512 | 917.665 | 907.125 | -1.15% |

| pro | 128 | 1228.166 | 1637.000 | +33.29% |
| pro | 256 | 1636.918 | 1663.000 | +1.59% |
| pro | 512 | 2415.108 | 2582.000 | +6.91% |

| pro | 8192 | 25203.000 | 25761.000 | +2.21% |

Aggregate regression versus PR383:

- all 22 cases: +20.36% geometric mean;
- M <= 128: +45.93% geometric mean;
- M >= 256: +2.51% geometric mean.

### NCU and NSYS findings

| implementation | launch topology | registers/thread | dynamic SMEM/CTA |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| candidate Flash M8 | one persistent kernel, 156 CTAs | 128 | 111.84 KiB |
| candidate Pro M8 | one persistent kernel, 156 CTAs | 128 | 102.62 KiB |
| PR383 Flash M8 | L1 + L2, 78 CTAs each | 168 | 231.70 KiB |
| PR383 Pro M8 | L1 + L2, 78 CTAs each | 168 | 213.76 KiB |

The candidate explicitly consumes two resident CTAs per H20 SM. PR383 runs
one high-resource CTA per SM for each phase. PM Sampling also reports only 25%
maximum active warps for the candidate and 18.75% for PR383; neither latency
case is occupancy-throughput limited. Absolute replay timings and sampled
utilization vary widely across ranks, so the stable evidence is the launch and
resource topology rather than the replay duration.

Low-perturbation NSYS confirms one fused candidate launch versus two sequential
PR383 launches. Even this mode inflates timings and reverses the uninstrumented
ranking, so it is retained as a dependency/timeline view only.

### Next experiments

1. For M <= 128, test a 78-worker cooperative grid while preserving the
   156-worker path for M >= 256. This directly tests whether the second
   resident CTA amplifies dispatch, grid-barrier, and low-work contention.
2. If 78 workers help, compile a true one-CTA/SM latency variant with a relaxed
   launch bound and a larger per-CTA register budget to eliminate spills.
3. Specialize fixed dispatch/combine barriers only after the worker-count
   experiment quantifies their contribution.
4. Reject any change that regresses either model at M >= 256 beyond run-to-run
   noise.

### Result

No kernel behavior changed in iteration 00. The benchmark values above remain
the branch baseline.

## Rejected experiment R01: one worker CTA per SM

### Reason and direction

NCU showed a 156-CTA candidate grid versus 78 CTAs per PR383 phase. To test
whether the second resident CTA was mostly fixed dispatch/barrier overhead,
M <= 128 was changed temporarily from `2 * physical_sms` workers to
`physical_sms` workers. The kernel remained at 128 registers/thread and kept
the same pipeline; M >= 256 was untouched.

### Performance

| model | M | baseline us | experiment us | change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| flash | 8 | 449.780 | 656.990 | +46.07% |
| flash | 16 | 494.348 | 723.421 | +46.34% |

Both points used the full 50-observation benchmark contract. The experiment
was stopped after the second completed point because the regression was far
outside measurement noise; the source change was reverted and not committed.

### Conclusion

The second resident CTA provides necessary compute parallelism in the current
128-register kernel. A useful one-CTA path must also reclaim the per-SM
register/shared-memory budget and change the pipeline, rather than only
shrinking the grid. The next iteration therefore targets latency-path register
pressure or fixed synchronization inside the existing two-CTA grid.

## Iteration 02: blockwise Flash swap-AB for M <= 32

### Reason

NCU ruled out local-memory traffic as the baseline bottleneck: Pro M8 reported
zero local loads/stores, while the fused kernel spent 18.73% of sampled cycles
on long-scoreboard stalls versus 4.86-6.08% in PR383's two phase kernels. The
baseline also issues an M64 x N128 WGMMA for experts that commonly own fewer
than eight tokens. Repository history showed that an earlier per-tensor-scale
kernel avoided this waste by swapping the WGMMA operands at small M, but the
path was removed when routed activations changed to per-block scaling.

### Direction

- Keep the 156-CTA, two-resident-CTA launch topology proven necessary by R01.
- Treat each N64 weight half as WGMMA M and bucket routed tokens into WGMMA N8,
  N16, N32, or N64.
- Preserve the current blockwise numerical contract: promote each L1 K128 and
  L2 K64 group with its staged activation scale, and retain cross-promotion
  partials as packed BF16.
- Remap the swapped L1 result through SwiGLU and a cross-warp dynamic-scale
  reduction; remap L2 back into the existing BF16 scatter layout.
- Use epilogue-exclusive C/D shared memory for the scale reduction. Reusing a
  released pipeline stage caused the producer to overwrite the reduction
  scratch and was rejected during correctness development.
- Enable the specialization only for routed-only Flash with M <= 32. The
  crossover sweep below shows that M64 is neutral-to-slower and M128 is a clear
  regression.

### Crossover sweep

This sweep temporarily enabled swap-AB through M128. It uses the same 50
observations, cold-L2 policy, and `max_rank_median_us` score as the baseline.

| M | baseline us | swap-AB us | change |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | 449.780 | 414.278 | -7.89% |
| 16 | 494.348 | 450.907 | -8.79% |
| 32 | 503.078 | 463.545 | -7.86% |
| 64 | 487.814 | 493.518 | +1.17% |
| 128 | 489.759 | 683.926 | +39.64% |

### Final performance

After fixing the selector at M <= 32, all five points were rerun from the final
source. M64 and M128 compile the regular baseline path.

| M | baseline us | final us | change | PR383 us | gap to PR383 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | 449.780 | 413.731 | -8.01% | 301.924 | +37.03% |
| 16 | 494.348 | 445.744 | -9.83% | 312.858 | +42.47% |
| 32 | 503.078 | 456.946 | -9.17% | 328.370 | +39.16% |
| 64 | 487.814 | 483.059 | -0.97% | 361.647 | +33.57% |
| 128 | 489.759 | 508.761 | +3.88% | 433.330 | +17.41% |

The geometric-mean gain over the branch baseline is 9.01% for the three
enabled points and 4.97% over M8-M128. The remaining M8-M32 geometric-mean gap
to PR383 falls from 53.30% to 39.54%. The unchanged M128 path varied by +3.88%
in this run; it has no generated swap-AB code and is retained as run-to-run
noise rather than widening the selector.

### Correctness and resource result

- Eight-rank `production.flash_m32` with forced ring wrap passes at
  `diff=0.000656` (`0.01` tolerance).
- The specialized kernel uses 128 registers and four barriers. PTXAS reports a
  448-byte stack frame, 518 bytes of spill stores, and 604 bytes of spill
  loads, plus serialized WGMMA due to the fixed 128-register launch bound.
- The resource report identifies the next target: shorten the live range of
  the swap epilogue/partial arrays enough to restore WGMMA issue parallelism,
  without giving up two resident CTAs.

## Iteration 03: extend blockwise swap-AB to Pro M <= 64

### Reason and direction

Iteration 02 left the largest small-M gaps in DSV4 Pro: +70.17% at M8 and
+47.73% at M64. Pro uses the same routed MXFP4 numerical contract and fixed
M64 x N128 Humming tile, so the validated blockwise swap-AB path was extended
to H7168/I3072. Pro aliases the second decoded-weight buffer with C/D shared
memory to preserve two-CTA occupancy; the alias is safe because the C/D
epilogue begins only after the routed mainloop has finished.

A temporary selector enabled the Pro path through M256 to locate the actual
crossover before choosing a production cutoff.

| M | baseline us | crossover sweep us | change |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | 1179.500 | 1060.000 | -10.13% |
| 16 | 1538.500 | 1350.000 | -12.25% |
| 32 | 1598.000 | 1395.500 | -12.67% |
| 64 | 1634.000 | 1461.000 | -10.59% |
| 128 | 1637.000 | 1773.500 | +8.34% |
| 256 | 1663.000 | 3957.000 | +137.94% |

The sweep used ten observations per point only to select the boundary. It
rejects M128/M256 and fixes the final Pro selector at M <= 64. The accepted
points were then rerun with the full 50-observation contract.

### Final performance

| M | baseline us | final us | change | PR383 us | gap to PR383 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | 1179.500 | 1042.000 | -11.66% | 693.125 | +50.33% |
| 16 | 1538.500 | 1328.000 | -13.68% | 971.170 | +36.74% |
| 32 | 1598.000 | 1390.500 | -12.98% | 1064.547 | +30.62% |
| 64 | 1634.000 | 1448.500 | -11.35% | 1106.107 | +30.95% |
| 128 | 1637.000 | 1646.500 | +0.58% | 1228.166 | +34.06% |

The four enabled points improve by 12.42% geometric mean. Their geometric-
mean gap to PR383 falls from 56.36% to 36.94%. Across Pro M8-M128, including
the unchanged M128 path, the gain is 9.97% geometric mean.

### Correctness and resource result

- Eight-rank, forced-ring-wrap validation passes at `diff=0.005395` for
  `production.pro_m32` and `diff=0.003913` for `production.pro_m64`.
- PTXAS reports 128 registers, four barriers, a 488-byte stack frame, 584
  bytes of spill stores, and 732 bytes of spill loads for Pro M32, with the
  same fixed-register WGMMA serialization warning as Flash.
- The next optimization should split the shared blockwise math from the
  model-specific remap so the N8/N16 specializations do not carry arrays sized
  for N64. That is the most direct route to reduce the reported local frame and
  long-scoreboard pressure while preserving the proven launch topology.

## Iteration 04: post-iteration profiler and final matrix

### Matched large-M validation

The optimized selectors are false above Flash M32 and Pro M64, but a first
three-observation rerun showed enough node variance to make Flash M256 appear
8.84% slower than the earlier branch baseline. A ten-observation recheck gave
526.617 us versus the earlier 533.920 us, confirming that the source-identical
path had not regressed. PR383 was then run immediately after the candidate on
the same H20 node for a matched large-M comparison.

| model | M | final us | matched PR383 us | gap |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| flash | 256 | 526.617 | 520.417 | +1.19% |
| flash | 512 | 951.115 | 965.191 | -1.46% |
| flash | 1024 | 1609.000 | 1563.810 | +2.89% |
| flash | 2048 | 2855.000 | 2743.821 | +4.05% |
| flash | 4096 | 5392.000 | 5099.000 | +5.75% |
| flash | 8192 | 10345.000 | 9899.000 | +4.51% |
| pro | 256 | 1727.000 | 1678.652 | +2.88% |
| pro | 512 | 2585.000 | 2455.305 | +5.28% |
| pro | 1024 | 4031.000 | 4067.000 | -0.89% |
| pro | 2048 | 7108.000 | 7084.000 | +0.34% |
| pro | 4096 | 13332.000 | 13010.000 | +2.48% |
| pro | 8192 | 25884.000 | 24955.000 | +3.72% |

The matched M >= 256 geometric-mean gap is +2.54%, effectively unchanged from
the original +2.51%. Combining it with the 50-observation small-M results gives
a +16.19% geometric-mean gap over all 22 Flash/Pro points, down from +20.36%.
The M <= 128 gap falls more substantially, from +45.93% to +34.99%.

### Post-iteration NCU

The table reports medians across eight application-replay reports for Pro M8.
Rank-local utilization is highly skewed by distributed replay, so these values
are diagnostic trends rather than throughput scores.

| counter | baseline | final swap-AB |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| local-load sectors | 0 | 675904 |
| local-store sectors | 0 | 562560 |
| issue active | 2.71% | 4.51% |
| tensor-pipe active | 0.085% | 0.130% |
| barrier stall | 62.45% | 62.37% |
| long-scoreboard stall | 18.73% | 75.38% |

Swap-AB increases useful issue/tensor activity and reduces unproductive padded
WGMMA work enough to win despite introducing a large local-memory frame. The
unchanged barrier median says grid synchronization is no longer the first
optimization target. The new local traffic and fourfold long-scoreboard median
agree with PTXAS's 488-byte Pro stack frame and are the clearest remaining
bottleneck.

### Post-iteration NSYS

Low-perturbation rank-0 traces retain the same one-kernel, 156-CTA persistent
topology. Their single-launch durations move from 755.548 to 744.348 us for
Flash M8 (-1.48%) and from 1603.704 to 1399.545 us for Pro M8 (-12.73%). NSYS
still perturbs the collective launch enough that these durations are not used
as the benchmark score; the trace is evidence that no extra phase or launch
was added.

## Rejected experiment R04: stage swap-AB SwiGLU in shared memory

### Reason and direction

Iteration 04 attributed the remaining small-M bottleneck to the swap-AB local
frame. R04 tested whether the epilogue's 32 FP32 post-SwiGLU values and 16
inverse scales per thread were responsible. The experiment staged a row-major
BF16 post-SwiGLU tile in epilogue-exclusive C/D shared memory, retained only
the current eight-token chunk in registers, and compressed the staging tile to
FP8 in place. This added one warpgroup barrier per token chunk while preserving
the 156-CTA, two-resident-CTA topology.

### Resource and correctness result

All forced-ring-wrap cases passed the 0.01 tolerance: Flash M32 at 0.000661,
Pro M32 at 0.002372, and Pro M64 at 0.002741. Resource usage barely changed:

| model | stack before/after | spill stores before/after | spill loads before/after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Flash | 448 / 440 B | 518 / 514 B | 604 / 596 B |
| Pro | 488 / 480 B | 584 / 572 B | 732 / 720 B |

The persistent WGMMA serialization warning remained. The small resource delta
shows that these epilogue arrays were not the dominant source of the local
frame; the accumulator lifetime across the routed mainloop remains the primary
suspect.

### Screening performance

The experiment used ten cold-L2 observations and 20 launches per observation.
`change` compares it with the accepted 50-observation Iteration 02/03 result.

| model | M | accepted us | R04 us | change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Flash | 8 | 413.731 | 453.184 | +9.54% |
| Flash | 16 | 445.744 | 491.462 | +10.26% |
| Flash | 32 | 456.946 | 489.124 | +7.04% |
| Pro | 8 | 1042.000 | 1069.500 | +2.64% |
| Pro | 16 | 1328.000 | 1404.000 | +5.72% |
| Pro | 32 | 1390.500 | 1405.000 | +1.04% |
| Pro | 64 | 1448.500 | 1486.000 | +2.59% |

The extra synchronization costs substantially more than the 8-12 byte spill
reduction saves, so the kernel change was reverted. The full remote evidence is
under `/app/deepgemm-auto-results/iter05-shared-swiglu` on the H20 pod.

### Recommended next iterations

1. Test a swap-AB-only launch-bound specialization that permits the existing
   48/208-register warpgroup reconfiguration to take effect. The current
   two-CTA launch bound caps every thread at 128 registers, ignores
   `setmaxnreg`, spills, and serializes WGMMA. Keep the regular large-M kernel
   at two-CTA launch bounds.
2. If the extra register budget does not offset lower residency, consume the
   existing packed BF16 routed accumulator directly in the swap epilogue. This
   avoids converting it into a second 64-float per-thread array, while adding
   no shared-memory barriers.
3. Do not key a maximum N8/N16/N32 bucket only from global M: one expert can
   receive skewed routes aggregated from all ranks, so its runtime `valid_m`
   may require the N64 fallback even when per-rank M is small.
4. Re-profile local sectors and long-scoreboard stalls after each resource
   change. If spilling is removed but the small-M gap remains above 20%,
   prototype a true two-phase L1/L2 latency kernel for M <= 64, matching
   PR383's one-CTA-per-SM resource allocation while keeping the fused kernel
   for throughput sizes.
5. Preserve the measured crossover guards: Flash M <= 32 and Pro M <= 64.
   Every future change should rerun M64/M128 boundaries plus the full DSV4
   Flash/Pro matrix so a latency win cannot leak into the throughput path.
