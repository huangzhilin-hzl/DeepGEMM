Profiler timings are deliberately not substituted for the benchmark score.
NCU replay and multi-process NSYS tracing perturb the cooperative workload;
they are used for topology, resource, and bottleneck attribution only.

## Iteration 00: baseline and profiler plumbing

### Reason

The original profiler scripts did not delimit the single production launch,
and NCU replay of all eight distributed processes deadlocked at collective
barriers. Add an opt-in CUDA profiler range to `--profile-only`, then run one
NCU instance per rank so every participant advances through the same replay
pass.

### Direction

- `DG_NCU_RANGE=1` wraps only the target launch, its device synchronize, and
  the rank barrier with `cudaProfilerStart/Stop`.
- The environment variable defaults to zero, so normal correctness and
  performance runs are unchanged.
- NCU uses eight independent application-replay profilers and PM Sampling.
- NSYS uses a low-perturbation mode: only rank 0 is traced while ranks 1-7 run
  normally.

### Baseline performance

`delta` is `(candidate / PR383 - 1) * 100`; positive values are regressions.

Aggregate regression versus PR383:

- all 22 cases: +20.36% geometric mean;
- M <= 128: +45.93% geometric mean;
- M >= 256: +2.51% geometric mean.

### NCU and NSYS findings

| implementation | launch topology | registers/thread | dynamic SMEM/CTA |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| candidate Flash M8 | one persistent kernel, 156 CTAs | 128 | 111.84 KiB |
| candidate Pro M8 | one persistent kernel, 156 CTAs | 128 | 102.62 KiB |
| PR383 Flash M8 | L1 + L2, 78 CTAs each | 168 | 231.70 KiB |
| PR383 Pro M8 | L1 + L2, 78 CTAs each | 168 | 213.76 KiB |

The candidate explicitly consumes two resident CTAs per H20 SM. PR383 runs
one high-resource CTA per SM for each phase. PM Sampling also reports only 25%
maximum active warps for the candidate and 18.75% for PR383; neither latency
case is occupancy-throughput limited. Absolute replay timings and sampled
utilization vary widely across ranks, so the stable evidence is the launch and
resource topology rather than the replay duration.

Low-perturbation NSYS confirms one fused candidate launch versus two sequential
PR383 launches. Even this mode inflates timings and reverses the uninstrumented
ranking, so it is retained as a dependency/timeline view only.

### Next experiments

1. For M <= 128, test a 78-worker cooperative grid while preserving the
   156-worker path for M >= 256. This directly tests whether the second
   resident CTA amplifies dispatch, grid-barrier, and low-work contention.
2. If 78 workers help, compile a true one-CTA/SM latency variant with a relaxed
   launch bound and a larger per-CTA register budget to eliminate spills.
3. Specialize fixed dispatch/combine barriers only after the worker-count
   experiment quantifies their contribution.
4. Reject any change that regresses either model at M >= 256 beyond run-to-run
   noise.

### Result

No kernel behavior changed in iteration 00. The benchmark values above remain
the branch baseline.

## Rejected experiment R01: one worker CTA per SM

### Reason and direction

NCU showed a 156-CTA candidate grid versus 78 CTAs per PR383 phase. To test
whether the second resident CTA was mostly fixed dispatch/barrier overhead,
M <= 128 was changed temporarily from `2 * physical_sms` workers to
`physical_sms` workers. The kernel remained at 128 registers/thread and kept
the same pipeline; M >= 256 was untouched.

### Performance

| model | M | baseline us | experiment us | change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| flash | 8 | 449.780 | 656.990 | +46.07% |
| flash | 16 | 494.348 | 723.421 | +46.34% |

Both points used the full 50-observation benchmark contract. The experiment
was stopped after the second completed point because the regression was far
outside measurement noise; the source change was reverted and not committed.

### Conclusion

The second resident CTA provides necessary compute parallelism in the current
128-register kernel. A useful one-CTA path must also reclaim the per-SM
register/shared-memory budget and change the pipeline, rather than only
shrinking the grid. The next iteration therefore targets latency-path register
pressure or fixed synchronization inside the existing two-CTA grid.
